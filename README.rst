Philbin Silicon Simulator
=========================

A work in progress...  

After watching `Crash Course Computer Science`_ I decided a wanted to make my own computer, after realising it would require a lot of transistors that I didn't have, I thought "hey, if I could code one transistor, I could use it many times".  

I have no idea what I was thinking!

Named after the host of the show `Carrie Anne Philbin`_.
